The enviornment model of procedure application
can be summarized by two rules:

- A procedure object is applied to a set of
  arguments by:
  - Constructing a frame
  - Binding the formal parameters of the
    procedure to the arguments of the call
  - Evaluating the body of the procedure in
    context of the new enviornment contrsucted.
  The new frame has as its enclosing enviornment
  the enviornment part of the proedure object
  being applied.

- A procedure is creased by evalutaing a lambda
  expression relative to a given enviornment.
  The resulting procedure object is a pair consisting
  of the text of the lambda expression and a pointer
  to the enviornment in which the procedure was created.
